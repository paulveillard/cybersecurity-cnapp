An ongoing & curated collection of awesome software best practices and techniques, libraries and frameworks, E-books and videos, websites, blog posts, links to github Repositories, technical guidelines and important resources about Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) in Cybersecurity.
> Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! Our goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.


## What is Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms?

**Cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs)** are a unified and tightly integrated set of security and compliance capabilities, designed to protect cloud-native infrastructure and applications. 
- According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-native-application-protection-platforms), CNAPP is a security platform that provides consistent visibility and control over all cloud-native applications.

> CNAPPs incorporate an integrated set of proactive and reactive security capabilities, including artifact scanning, security guardrails, configuration and compliance management, risk detection and prioritization, and behavioral analytics, providing visibility, governance and control from code creation to production runtime. CNAPP solutions use a combination of API integrations with leading cloud platform providers, continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) pipeline integrations, and agent and agentless workload integration to offer combined development and runtime security coverage

# CNAPP & DevSecOps
Lack of visibility is a major driver of CNAPP adoption and security responsibility has expanded beyond infosec teams to include additional personas. Gartner shares the following insight:  

> With operational responsibilities shifting toward developers and cloud architects, the need for advanced tools to address vulnerabilities, deploy infrastructure as code and manage production implementations has grown to accommodate this expanded scope. Proactively identifying and prioritizing risks during development, while providing developers with adequate context, is essential due to developers perceiving security as an obstacle.

Meanwhile, as cloud security becomes democratized internally, attackers are also evolving their techniques and targets: 

- The attack surface of cloud-native applications and infrastructure is expanding, with attackers focusing on:
  - the runtime environment,
    - including network, compute, storage,
    -  identities and permissions,
    -  and the misconfiguration of cloud management and control features.
Additionally, APIs and the software supply chain itself have become targets for potential attacks.
